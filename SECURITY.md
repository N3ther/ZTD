# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

As of June 17th, 2020, all versions above 0.1.0a are supported. 0.0.5a and below are not supported as the programming language used has changed, and I'd be suprised if someone manages to find a security vulnerability in a launcher with no program to launch.

| Version   | Supported          |
| --------- | ------------------ |
| 0.1.1a    | :white_check_mark: |
| 0.1.0a    | :white_check_mark: |
| < 0.1.0a  | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find a security vulnerability, join the discord at https://discord.gg/tmG9kfH. My name on discord is
