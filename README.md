# ZAD/ZTD
(ZTD is the old name of the game, it's now called ZAD)
What is ZTD/ZAD?

ZTD, or Zone to Defend, is an open source first person shooter made in the Godot engine (very early versions were made in Java). ZTD takes place in an alternate reality in the mid to late 2000s, where libertarian socialist movements around the world have risen up against the state! ZTD is simmilar to TF2, as you can play as either team as a class. However, ZTD also has building, and each map is fully destructable! It's in very early development currently, so if you want to help out, please fork it and make a pull request!

This game is currently being worked on by several people, which you can find on our discord server at https://discord.gg/tmG9kfH!
Thanks to spacemanjaune (a good friend of mine) for coming up with the idea!
