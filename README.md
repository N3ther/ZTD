What is ZTD?

ZTD, or Zone to Defend, is an open source first person shooter made in the Godot engine (very early versions were made in Java). ZTD takes place in the near future, where anarchist movements around the world have risen up against the state! ZTD is simmilar to TF2, as you can play as either team as a class. However, ZTD also has building, and each map is fully destructable! It's in very early development currently, so if you want to help out, please fork it and make a pull request!
